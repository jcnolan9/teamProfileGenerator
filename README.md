# teamProfileGenerator

## Description
In this project I use the npm package Inquirer to prompt a user for information about a work team. The user is prompted for information about the team mananger including the 
manager's name, id, email, office number, etc. The user is also prompted to enter similar information for any engineers and/or interns on the team. Object-Oriented programming principles
are used here as the manager, engineers, and interns are instances of the Manger, Engineer, and Intern classes. These classes are in sub-classes of the Employee superclass. Upon entering
all the information an HTML page is generated showing the whole team!
